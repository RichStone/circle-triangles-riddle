# Circles Triangle Riddle

The smallest possible triangle consists of 3 circles.
From the next bigger triangle you can build several triangles.
The amount of triangles you can build increases algorithmically.

Can you figure out:  
1. How many triangles are in a big triangle? How do you figure this out in a triangle like:

```
       *  
      * *  
     * * *  
    * * * *  
   * * * * *  
  * * * * * *  
 * * * * * * *  
```

2. How many circles are in this triangle?

# Solution
See the CircleTriangle class in the CircleTriangle.py

# Installation

Simply download the script.


# Usage

Run the script with `python3 CircleTriangle.py` it will calculate the riddle
for 1500 triangles.

TDD was partially practiced here, you can run the tests with `python -m unittest TestCircleTriangle.py`
